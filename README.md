# Welcome to My GUI :muscle: :fire: 
Here’s a quick guide to help you get started::
# How to Use the Application
After downloading the application, you have two options to try the GUI:
 
1. #### **Install the Application:**
      Run MyAppInstaller_web.exe to install the application on your computer.
    
2. #### **Test the GUI Without Installation:**
      Run MY_GUI.exe to test the GUI directly without installing it. 
# Application Modes
Once the application is open, you’ll find two simulation modes:

# BER Mode Configuration
To use the BER mode, configure the following variables:

* Select the **Channel Name.**
* Select the **Number of Bits.**
* Select the **Start Value of EB/NO.**
* Select the **End Value of EB/NO.**
 
 # PDFS Mode Configuration
 To use the PDFS mode:
* Select the Channel Name.
    * The variables will automatically adjust based on the selected channel type.

 # MY GUI Feature
 This section provides a basic overview of the most frequently used operations in MY GUI.
 # Bit Error Rate (BER) Simulation
 The goal is to simulate the Bit Error Rate (BER) over the following channels:
* **Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)** Channel
* **Uni-polar, Bipolar, and Polar** Channels
* **Rician Fading** Channel
* **Rayleigh Fading** Channel

# Probability Density Function (PDF) Simulation
The goal is to simulate the Probability Density Function (PDF) for the following distributions:
* **Normal (Gaussian)** Distribution
* **Rician** Distribution
* **Nakagami** Distribution
* **Rayleigh** Distribution
